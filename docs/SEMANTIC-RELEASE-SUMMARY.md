# Semantic Release Implementation Summary

## What Was Done

I've successfully set up automated releases for cls-extended using semantic-release. Here's everything that was configured:

### 1. Package Configuration

**File**: `packages/core/package.json`

Changes made:

- ✅ Changed package name from `@cls-extended/core` to `cls-extended`
- ✅ Set version to `0.0.0-development` (managed by semantic-release)
- ✅ Configured `publishConfig.access: "public"` for npm

### 2. Semantic Release Configuration

**File**: `packages/core/.releaserc.json`

Configured plugins:

- ✅ `@semantic-release/commit-analyzer` - Analyzes commits to determine version bump
- ✅ `@semantic-release/release-notes-generator` - Generates release notes
- ✅ `@semantic-release/changelog` - Updates CHANGELOG.md
- ✅ `@semantic-release/npm` - Publishes to npm registry
- ✅ `@semantic-release/git` - Commits version changes back to repo
- ✅ `@semantic-release/github` - Creates GitHub releases

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/release.yml`

Features:

- ✅ Triggers on push to `main` branch
- ✅ Runs tests before releasing
- ✅ Uses semantic-release v25
- ✅ Publishes to npm with provenance
- ✅ Creates GitHub releases automatically
- ✅ Proper permissions configured

### 4. Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:

- ✅ `docs/RELEASE-PROCESS.md` - Complete release process guide
- ✅ `docs/RELEASE-SETUP.md` - Step-by-step setup instructions
- ✅ `docs/SEMANTIC-RELEASE-SUMMARY.md` - This file
- ✅ `packages/core/CHANGELOG.md` - Changelog file (auto-updated)

### 5. README Updates

- ✅ Added npm version badge
- ✅ Added semantic-release badge
- ✅ Added contributing section
- ✅ Added commit convention guidelines
- ✅ Added release process information

## How It Works

### Commit → Release Flow

```
Developer commits with conventional format
         ↓
Push to main branch
         ↓
GitHub Actions triggered
         ↓
Run tests (lint, typecheck, build, test)
         ↓
Semantic-release analyzes commits
         ↓
Determine version bump (major/minor/patch)
         ↓
Update package.json version
         ↓
Generate CHANGELOG.md
         ↓
Build package
         ↓
Publish to npm
         ↓
Create GitHub release
         ↓
Create Git tag
         ↓
Commit changes back to repo
```

### Version Bumping Rules

| Commit Type                | Example                                      | Version Change |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `fix:`                     | `fix: resolve parser bug`                    | 0.1.0 → 0.1.1  |
| `feat:`                    | `feat: add new feature`                      | 0.1.0 → 0.2.0  |
| `BREAKING CHANGE:`         | `feat: redesign API\n\nBREAKING CHANGE: ...` | 0.1.0 → 1.0.0  |
| `docs:`, `chore:`, `test:` | `docs: update README`                        | No release     |

## What You Need to Do

### Before First Release

1. **Create npm Token**
   - Go to https://www.npmjs.com/
   - Login → Access Tokens → Generate New Token
   - Select "Automation" type
   - Copy the token

2. **Add npm Token to GitHub**
   - Go to repository Settings
   - Secrets and variables → Actions
   - New repository secret
   - Name: `NPM_TOKEN`
   - Value: (paste your token)

3. **Verify Package Name**
   - Check if `cls-extended` is available on npm
   - If taken, choose a different name

4. **Create First Release Commit**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: initial release of cls-extended

   This is the first public release featuring:
   - Zero runtime overhead
   - Universal build tool support
   - Full TypeScript support
   - Comprehensive test coverage"

   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Monitor Release**
   - Go to GitHub Actions tab
   - Watch the Release workflow
   - Check for any errors

6. **Verify Release**
   - Check GitHub Releases page
   - Verify package on npm
   - Test installation: `npm install -D cls-extended`

### For Future Releases

Just commit with conventional format and push to main:

```bash
# Patch release
git commit -m "fix: resolve issue with JSX parsing"

# Minor release
git commit -m "feat: add support for custom breakpoints"

# Major release (after 1.0.0)
git commit -m "feat: redesign plugin API

BREAKING CHANGE: The configuration format has changed.
See migration guide for details."
```
